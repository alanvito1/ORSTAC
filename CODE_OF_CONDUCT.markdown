# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge
We, as members, contributors, and maintainers of the ORSTAC community, pledge to make participation in our project and community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards
Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:
- Using welcoming and inclusive language.
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences.
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism.
- Focusing on what is best for the community.
- Showing empathy towards other community members.

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:
- The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances.
- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks.
- Public or private harassment.
- Publishing others' private information, such as physical or email addresses, without explicit permission.
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting.

## Our Responsibilities
Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope
This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces, including GitHub repositories, Telegram groups, and GitHub Discussions. It also applies when an individual is representing the project or its community in public spaces.

## Enforcement
Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project maintainer, Alan Victor, at [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/alanvito1/ORSTAC/issues) or via [Telegram](https://t.me/superbinarybots). All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All maintainers are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.
