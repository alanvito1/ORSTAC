# dBot Binary Bots Repository

Welcome to the largest repository of Deriv's Binary bots! Our goal is to share knowledge and learn from one another.

Our bots are specifically designed to work on Deriv's DBot platform, which you can access by [creating a Deriv account](https://track.deriv.com/_h1BT0Uryldi34Ib7uprVbWNd7ZgqdRLk/1/) or by [becoming a partner](https://track.deriv.com/_h1BT0Uryldilxv1B6h4gZ2Nd7ZgqdRLk/1/). Remember, "Game theory rules everything. Come to the game."

We've gathered a wide selection of robots for those interested in testing and using them. Each bot has one or more functions to explore, and studying them can even help you create your own bot.

Our tools are available to support your goals and encourage learning. Follow these steps to get started:
